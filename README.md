# 🧠 Anon Board — A Visual Space for Anonymous Emotions

**Anon Board** is a minimalist, emotion-driven web app where anyone can anonymously share what they're feeling.  
No accounts, no usernames — just pure emotion, visualized as colored dots on a shared board.

---

## 🌈 How It Works

- Users submit a short sentence describing how they feel.
- Each emotion is tagged with a color (e.g. blue = confusion, red = anger).
- Submissions appear as dots scattered randomly on a fullscreen board.
- Hovering or tapping a dot reveals the emotion behind it.
- You can’t reply, comment or like — just see that you’re not alone.

**“Someone else out there feels the same.”**
